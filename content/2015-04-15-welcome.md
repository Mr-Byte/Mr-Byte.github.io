Summary: Welcome to my new blog.

Welcome to my new blog!  This is where I plan to blog about programming topics and my hobbies.

I plan to blog about programming topics regarding C#, rust, TypeScript, and software design.  I also plan to blog about my hobbies which include charcuterie and 3d printing.  Stay tuned for more!  My first real post will be about my new project [query_rs](http://www.github.com/Mr-Byte/query_rs/).  A set of macros and iterators that emulate the C# LINQ syntax inside of rust.
